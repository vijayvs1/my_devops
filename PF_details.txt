
I have tried to with withdraw my PF 2 times, but not yet received the amount.

=================================================================
In first attempt to withdraw:

When I did not get the PF amount, then raised grievance to know the reason.
You said, there was something wrong with the my bank account and  epf amount has been returned back by the bank undelivered.
Below is your reply.
registrations number:SROKN/E/2018/01684.

In second attempt to withdraw:,
Again I did not get my PF amount in second attempt.
After few months I received I letter at my home address that, PF office have sent cheque of xxxx amount with this cheque number to your banker.
Letter is attached in the email and in grievance.

My Question:

1. To which banker and at which location you had sent my cheque?
2. Why you did not inform me about the same?
3. Wherever you have sent my cheque, now it might not get clear because it's older than 6 months now. In such case what to do next?
